**Login/Register/Admin**
First, open accounts.db and refresh the database to make sure everything is up to date.

Run the app starting from LoginMain. You’ll get the option to create an account. Once you sign up, go to the Personal Information tab and copy your student email this will be your login going forward. In addition when creating your account please make sure to use student email.

After creating your account, you won’t be able to do much except view your info until you’re accepted into the school. To do that, log in as an admin using the credentials provided above. Search for your student ID, which you can find in the database next to your name.

When you find your profile, click on Review Application and then Accept. After that, your student account will be fully active and you’ll be able to register for classes and use everything in the app.

If you want to skip all of that, there’s a custom login provided below for quick access.



If you would like to skip these steps shown above there will be a custom login made below for you already.

**AdvisorChatGuide**

When chatting with Dr. Thompson in the AdvisorChat screen, try including key words or phrases related to your issue so she can respond appropriately. You can type things like “register” or “schedule” if it’s about classes, “graduation” or “graduating” if you're near the end of your program, and “withdraw” or “withdrawing” if you're thinking about dropping a class. If you're worried about academic standing, using words like “probation,” “reported,” or “consequences” helps. Even casual inputs like “thanks” or “appreciate” are recognized. Keeping your messages clear and relevant helps the chat respond more effectively.
